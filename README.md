I want to make an app for my girlfriend. As of right now, I don't have any grind ideas for solving a real world problem. I just want to have fun with class and learn as much as possible. I think have minigames or little animations would be cute. 

## Notes

Could not get the button to work, but after redoing the process as outlined I got it to work.
